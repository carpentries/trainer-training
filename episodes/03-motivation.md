## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. There are many demotivating “traps” an instructor can fall into. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering from these slip-ups?

1. How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to the process of learning to becoming a better teacher?

1. How can we support our learners in transferring metacognitive skills to the materials learned in a workshop?

1. Make a concept map (3-5 items with labeled connections) that links one or more of the strategies on p.200-211 to one or more practices that could be implemented in a workshop to support metacognition. What concepts did you connect? What relationships did you identify?

1. Examine Figure 4.2 (p.97). Think of an situation you’ve encountered in a classroom that is explained by this figure.

1. Will learners at Carpentries workshops  have primarily learning goals or performance goals? What about at Instructor Training events?

1. Which are the strategies on p.99-104 are most relevant to Carpentries workshops and trainings? Are any of them not relevant in this setting? Why or why not?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- We expect trainees to have diverse motivations for joining Instructor Training.
- Although Carpentries workshops and trainings are short, there are many strategies that we can employ to keep learners and trainees motivated.
