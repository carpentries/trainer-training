## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. Not all trainees are interested in completing checkout for certification. Weâ€™re ok with that! What we worry about is when trainees who do want to certify are intimidated or deterred by some part of the process. What role can a Trainer play in supporting or encouraging trainees who want to complete the checkout process?

1. What questions do you have about policies and procedures for running a workshop? Where do you think trainees might find this information confusing or unclear?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The Carpentries can appear large and complicated to newcomers, and Instructor Training may be a trainee's first encounter with the community. 
- Instructor Trainers may need to overcome their own expert awareness gaps in relation to The Carpentries while teaching Instructor Training.
