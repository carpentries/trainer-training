4\. The prospect of responding to a Code of Conduct violation is frightening, but we want Instructors to feel empowered to act and report if an incident occurs. This confidence starts with their Trainers. How do *you* feel about the prospect of handling an incident at a workshop? What questions do you have? What questions do you worry you won't be able to answer?
