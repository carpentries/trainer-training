## Practice Teaching

Individuals who didn't practice teaching last week will be selected to teach 3 minutes of their chosen lesson episode from Instructor Training. You can incorporate negative teaching practices, if desired. After you finish teaching, you will give yourself feedback and then receive feedback from other group members using The Carpentries 2x2 rubric. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Discussion Questions

1. What questions do you have about policies and procedures for running a workshop or training? Where do you think trainees might find this information confusing or unclear?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The Carpentries can appear large and complicated to newcomers, and Instructor Training may be a trainee's first encounter with the community. 
- Instructor Trainers may need to overcome their own expert awareness gaps in relation to The Carpentries while teaching Instructor Training.
