## Reading:

From The Carpentries [Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/index.html): 

* [Live Coding is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/17-live.html)
* [More Practice Live Coding](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/20-performance.html)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Practice Teaching

Five members of the group will be selected to teach 3 minutes of their chosen lesson episode from Instructor Training. You can incorporate negative teaching practices, if desired. After you finish teaching, you will give yourself feedback and then receive feedback from other group members using The Carpentries 2x2 rubric.

## Discussion Questions

After the teaching demonstrations are complete, session leader will choose questions from below for discussion: 

1. Three minutes is not a lot of time! It is very common to get feedback that trainees wanted the practice teaching sessions to be longer. Do you think they should be longer? If so, why? If not, how do we help trainees use this time wisely?

1. Using breakout rooms for the practice teaching exercises means that Instructor Trainers don't have a chance to observe (or at least can't observe all sessions). What are the benefits to this? Do you think the non-teaching Instructor Trainer should join one of the breakout rooms, float between rooms, or stay in the main room? Why?

1. What other questions, concerns, or ideas do you have about how to effectively teach participatory live coding? 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Participatory live coding is one of the core teaching practices of The Carpentries, and important to give trainees (useful!) practice in.
- It's important to practice our own teaching and giving and receiving feedback!
