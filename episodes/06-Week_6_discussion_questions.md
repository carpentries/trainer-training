3\. This module includes an activity for assessing your trainees' backgrounds. How might you use this information?

#### [How Learning Works: The Importance of Practice](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/) 
4\. Try creating a concept map that relates the following 3 concepts: 
- skill acquisition
- mental models
- formative assessment
    
5\. We introduce skill acquisition in this module, but really dig into expertise in the next. What is the purpose of introducing skill acquisition here? What should be emphasized here, vs in the next section?

6\. Dismissive language can occur as a result of negligence, but it can also happen as a result of good intentions.
Trainees are often surprised to be told that telling learners that a task is "easy" is dismissive.
How would you help someone who wants to convey to learners that a task is *achievable* to find a way to convey that message in a more motivating way?

#### [Memory and Cognitive Load](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/index.html)
7\. This episode explains why we should teach slowly and allow time for practice. However, many of our curricula contain 
more content than can sometimes be covered in our '2-day' format. How can we help our trainees remember to keep it slow and 
resist the urge to 'get through' everything by talking faster?
