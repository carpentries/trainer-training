keypoints:
- "The Instructor Trainer role comes with powers and responsibilities. Some powers are limited to preserve sustainability of The Carpentries, but we will work with you to meet your goals as closely as possible."
- "Teaching and learning are separate, though related, processes. And then there is learning to teach!"
- "Most popular texts do not aim to onboard readers to engaging with primary literature in a field. This presents barriers to responsible engagement across disciplines, particularly in education."

## Overview of Trainer Training
This program is an on-boarding course designed to support Carpentries community-members in preparing to teach Instructor 
Training workshops. It is not a substitute for Instructor Training; in contrast, this training includes fewer contact hours 
and more independent work time stretched over a 10 week period. 

Each participant brings a different skill set to this training. Most trainees have background in educational settings and/or 
experience teaching Carpentries-style workshops. Trainees who are new to both should plan to invest extra effort in the 
readings. All trainees, and particularly those new to the community, are expected to seek continuing connection and mentorship through engagement with the 
Trainer community after completing this training.

> ## Trainer Checkout
> In addition to attending weekly meetings, there are additional requirements for Trainer certification. These are:
> - Observe a teaching demonstration session
> - Observe (with option to participate) 4 hours of an Instructor Training workshop 
> - Trainees who are not certified Carpentries Instructors should complete Instructor certification concurrently. This 
> includes attending a full Instructor Training workshop as a learner if not yet attended. Attending a workshop or demo within 
> the training time frame can fulfill the above requirements for observation if requested.

Each week, we will discuss assigned readings. Discussion questions are provided to offer a framework for conversation; 
however, we will always begin with trainee perspectives and interests, and discussion may digress substantially from the 
discussion questions. While the questions can help to focus attention on important points, please also read to prepare for 
broader conversation about the ideas and challenges in the readings each week.

At sessions 2-9, one participant will play each of the following roles:
- **Lead:** facilitates discusssion of the first question each week and selects from remaining questions to focus additional conversation, using breakout rooms as 
desired. The Lead role is not about being an authority on the week's reading, but rather is an opportunity to practice guiding discussion on Zoom. Your host will 
be available to discuss Zoom and facilitation questions during breakouts, and will also address questions or concerns as needed during discussion.
- **Challenger:** responsible for making sure that areas where Trainers or Instructor trainees may have questions or doubts are 
recognized and discussed during our sessions. Challengers should bring opposing viewpoints (even if they don't personally hold them) to be examined gently. 
Also helps out with notes when the Notetaker is speaking, loses connection, etc.
- **Notes:** takes notes on conversation in the collaborative document (Etherpad or Google Doc) for the session.

Your host will provide you with a proposed schedule for these roles for the full term. If it is impossible or impractical for you to play a role on any week 
assigned to you, please let your host know immediately.

### Instructor Training Workshops (in brief)
Most of our Instructor Training Workshops are taught online, via Zoom; some partner institutions also host workshops in-
person. All workshops must have a least 2 Instructor Trainers in attendance. New trainees should plan to be 
available for teaching assignments as soon as certification is complete. New Trainers will be matched with experienced 
Trainers whenever possible. New trainees are also welcome to request a role as a third trainer to reduce the teaching load 
and enhance observation opportunities during their first workshop.  


### The Trainer Community
[Trainers](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) meet monthly for calls at 2 different time slots to accommodate global time 
zones. Attending these calls his highly recommended (trainees are welcome!), and all Trainers are asked to review meeting 
notes when they are unable to attend, as
important information and updates are shared there. Regular meeting times are on the first Thursday of the month; however, 
we keep a 'placeholder' slot on the calendar for the 3rd week of the month. The placeholder can be used for special events 
or non-routine discussions, and is also a substitute time when the first week falls during a holiday. All meetings can be 
found on the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events) and joined via links on the [meeting Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/trainers).

Trainers also communicate asynchronously via Topicbox listserv, Slack, and GitHub. New trainees will be 
invited to join the Topicbox list early in their training, and will be added to the Trainers Slack channel once they have 
completed certification if they have registered with The [Carpentries Slack community](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/). Communications on the [Instructor Training GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training) can be received by "following" the repository. 
We also suggest joining The [Carpentries Discuss listserv](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss) on Topicbox for 
anyone who has not done so already.

> - "Follow" the Instructor Training GitHub repository:  https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training
> - Carpentries Discuss listserv: https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss This list is for general conversations in the Carpentries community. You will be invited separately to join the private Trainers list on TopicBox.

### Trainers Leadership
A Trainers Leadership committee has been provisionally appointed and is currently in the process of drafting a 
governance structure specific to the Trainers' community and planning an election. Stay tuned for more details!


### A Culture of Contribution
Instructor Trainers are a vital part of The Carpentries community, and not only because they teach Instructors! Most Trainers take 
on leadership roles in their communities, locally or globally. Many assume leadership within the Trainer community, and all 
are expected to contribute. Whatever your plans, don't wait to get involved! If you see a typo in the 
curriculum, try out a pull request to fix it, or ask around to learn how. If you wonder if a section could be better, 
search the repository for existing issues on the subject, and add your voice to the conversation or start a new issue for us 
to work through during our next update. Consider joining Trainer meetings now!


## Discussion Questions
### Carpentries Readings & Previews

1\. What questions do you have about being a Trainer? 

### _How Learning Works_: 
#### Foreword

2\. What do you think about the distinction between "Science of learning" and "Science of instruction"? How do you expect these 'sciences' to intersect? Where might they be different?
    
3\. _How Learning Works_ is presented as a solution to the “too soft/too hard” problem. What experience have you had with sources that are too soft or too hard? In education, programming, or other areas?
    
#### About the Authors

4\. How might the backgrounds and research interests of the authors shape their writing?
  

#### Introduction

5\.  This book is organized around seven principles for teaching. Discuss an example of how you’ve seen one of these principles influence learners’ experience. If you have experience with Carpentries workshops, can you think of an example in that context?
    
6\.  In our discussions, we will often move between levels in the diagram below. We will apply the 7 principles to *teaching about how to teach* (in an 
instructor training workshop) as well as *teaching technical skills* (in a Carpentries workshop). We'll even talk about *learning how to teach teaching* in your 
role as a Trainer! Do the 7 principles apply equally well to all of these contexts? Are there any important differences to keep in mind?
