## Reading:

From The Carpentries [Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/index.html): 

* [Live Coding is a Skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/17-live.html)
* [More Practice Live Coding](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/20-performance.html)

## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. Trainees are often quite nervous about teaching in front of their peers. What strategies can you use as a Trainer to help trainees have a positive (and useful) experience from their practice teaching sessions?

1. Three minutes is not a lot of time! It is very common to get feedback that trainees wanted the practice teaching sessions to be longer. Do you think they should be longer? If so, why? If not, how do we help trainees use this time wisely?

1. What principles from last week's reading on practice and feedback are being put into action in the episodes that form this week's reading? Are there any principles that are *not* being implemented?

1. Using breakout rooms for the practice teaching exercises means that Trainers don't have a chance to observe (or at least can't observe all sessions). What are the benefits to this? Do you think the non-teaching Trainer should join one of the breakout rooms, float between rooms, or stay in the main room? Why?

1. What other questions, concerns, or ideas do you have about how to effectively teach participatory live coding? 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Participatory live coding is one of the core teaching practices of The Carpentries, and important to give trainees (useful!) practice in.
