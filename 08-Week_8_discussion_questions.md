## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. What content do you think might be missing from the Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility episode that would be important for our Instructors to understand in the context of Carpentries workshops?

1. Try to identify one opportunity for interaction with learners during the Welcome episode. How might you use this to establish a positive learning environment without running out the clock?

1. How might The Carpentries Code of Conduct function in supporting an “explicitly centralizing” (p.167) classroom climate?

1. Choose a strategy among those suggested on pages 177-186 that seems useful or essential to a Carpentries workshop. What factors might prevent an Instructor from effectively implementing this strategy? As a Trainer, how might you help?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Student-centred teaching requires teaching students, not content. It requires not treating all students the same (equality) but giving each student what they need (equity).
- Class climate has a major impact on learning.
- Creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone in your workshop or training takes planning, self-reflection, and humility.
