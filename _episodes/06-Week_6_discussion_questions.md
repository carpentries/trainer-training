teaching: 0 
exercises: 0    
questions:  
- "Key question."    
objectives: 
- "Propose one way to support learner interaction early in a workshop even when pressed for time."
- "Apply a concept map to illustrate the importance of explicit connections in knowledge and learning." 
- "Distinguish challenges related to skill level faced by learners from those faced by Instructors."
- "Predict challenges posed by expert awareness gaps in the context of teaching Instructors how to teach."
- "Propose a strategy to support Instructor trainees in implementing guidance on pacing in spite of competing priorities related to content and time."
keypoints:  
- "The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum offers many opportunities to model, as well as to teach, good practices."
- "Skill acquisition models explain challenges faced by learners and Instructors, Instructor trainees and Trainers."
- "Expert teachers may have filled in awareness gaps in subjects they teach, but may still have gaps on the subject of teaching."
- "Going slowly is a challenge that takes constant effort and compromise."
- "There are many approaches and supporting documents available to teach Instructor Training. Many of these are referenced in the Instructor Notes."

### Instructor Training Curriculum
1\. What stands out or interests you from this week's reading? You may type your own response but also feel free to paste a snippet from the curriculum itself or from any of the comments/questions/replies in Hypothes.is. 

### [Welcome](https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/01-welcome/)
2\. This module introduces the Instructor Training workshop. Depending on how Trainers use the curriculum, this section can be more or less interactive and can 
take more or less time than it is formally allocated. This is especially important when workshops get off to a slow start for logistical reasons. Try to identify 
one opportunity for interaction with learners during this episode. How might you use this to establish a positive learning environment without running out the 
clock?

#### [Building Skill With Practice](https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/) 
3\. (Try not to skip this one!) Try creating a concept map that includes the following 3 concepts: 
- mental models
- analogies
- concept maps  
What connections did you make during this process?
    
4\. We introduce skill acquisition in this module, but really dig into expertise in the next. What is the purpose of introducing skill acquisition here? What 
should be emphasized here, vs in the next section?
    
#### [Expertise and Instruction](https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/04-expertise/)
5\. Do you think you might have any expert awareness gaps on the subject of teaching or learning? How might such gaps become apparent when teaching others how to teach?


#### [Memory and Cognitive Load](https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/index.html)
6\. This episode explains why we should teach slowly and allow time for practice. However, many of our curricula contain 
more content than can sometimes be covered in our '2-day' format. How can we help our trainees remember to keep it slow and 
resist the urge to 'get through' everything by talking faster?
