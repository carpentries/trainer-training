title: "Week 8 Discussion Questions"    
teaching: 0 
exercises: 0 
objectives:
- "Suggest ways in which Trainers can support Instructor trainees who may be intimidated or confused by checkout procedures."
- "Identify confusing features of The Carpentries operational landscape."
- "Predict likely characteristics of Instructor trainees, and compare predictions with others."
- "Apply learning objectives to identify checkpoints where objectives are met in a lesson about learning objectives!"
keypoints:  
- "Thinking critically about Bloom's Taxonomy is typically beyond the Blooms' level we can expect Instructor trainees to perform at. Examine *your* learning objectives carefully to calibrate your expectations for this episode and meet learners where they are."
- "Instructors are unlikely to face a Code of Conduct violation, but need to know what to do if this occurs. Reassurance of team support and clear instructions on reporting are the most important elements to communicate." 
- "Trainees may be intimidated by many elements of checkout. It is important to emphasize that teaching demonstrations are a friendly opportunity to give and receive feedback, not a high-stakes test, and that our Core Team is there to support them with any questions they may have during the checkout process."
- "Participatory live coding keeps participants engaged, generates immediate feedback, and creates opportunities to model a healthy response to error. These features explicitly support learning and motivation."
- "With instructional support, repeated practice and feedback can lead trainees to examine the component skills of teaching."

## Discussion Questions

### Instructor Training Curriculum
1\. What stood out to you from this week’s reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, 
things you’re not convinced of, or questions that you have.

#### [Checkout Process](https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/14-checkout/index.html) 
2\. Not all trainees are interested in completing checkout for certification. We're ok with that! What we worry about is 
when trainees who *do* want to certify are intimidated or deterred by some part of the process. What role can a Trainer play 
in supporting or encouraging trainees who want to complete the checkout process?

#### [The Carpentries: How We Operate](https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/15-carpentries/index.html)
3\. What questions do you have about policies and procedures for running a workshop? Where do you think trainees might find this information confusing or unclear?

#### [Preparing to Teach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html)
4\. Write a learner profile for an Instructor trainee and share with the group. How different are your profiles? What kinds of support might each of your 
imaginary trainees need?

5\. Examine the learning objectives for this episode. Where in the episode would you expect that objective to be met? How will you know? How will learners know?
