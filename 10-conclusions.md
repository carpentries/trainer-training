1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. What is one area of teaching skill that you would like to work on? How did you decide on that goal? How could you advise an Instructor to prioritize their skill development goals?

1. Introductions often include a lot of mundane content. How can an introduction cultivate motivation (per our recommendations) while still conveying necessary information?
