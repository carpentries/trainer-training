## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. When trainees give feedback, especially when giving feedback to themselves, they are VERY likely to comment on the number of times they said “um” or “uh” during their practice presentation. How would you go about helping them to level up their feedback to address more impactful features?

1. How can you (as an Instructor Trainer) use information in the pre and post-Instructor Training surveys to improve your teaching? How can we help Instructors make good use of pre and post-workshop surveys? 

1. In the context of a Carpentries workshop, what role does an Instructor play in creating opportunities for practice? What role does a helper play?

1. In what ways do learners in a workshop get feedback on their progress? Is that feedback likely to meet the criteria for useful feedback outlined in this chapter? Why or why not?

1. How can we, as a community, encourage and facilitate co-Instructors (and co-Trainers!) to share feedback with one another and live our core value of "Always Learning"?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Feedback is an essential part of Carpentries workshops and Instructor Training. Trainees often need guidance on how to invite, give, and receive good feedback.
- The ways that a team of Instructors and Helpers manages the learning environment of a workshop can have a profound effect on how much effective feedback learners receive. Instructor Training should make trainees aware of this and give them strategies to maximise their impact.
